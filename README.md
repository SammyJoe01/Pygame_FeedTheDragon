# **Feed the Dragon**
Feed the Dragon is a simple Pygame project where the player controls a dragon and tries to catch coins while avoiding missing them. The game gets progressively harder as the player catches more coins.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The image files, fonts and audios used in the program

## **Installing**
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/Feed-the-Dragon.git**

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 catch_the_clown.py

## **How to Play**
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the dragon up and down. The goal of the game is to catch as many coins as possible without missing any. If you miss a coin, you'll lose a life. The game is over when you run out of lives.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Changing the values in the game values section of the file. 
2. Changing the starting velocity of the coins or the acceleration rate of the coins.
3. Changing the number of lives the player starts with.
4. You can also customise the fonts, sounds, and images used in the game by replacing the files in the fonts, sounds, and images folders.
