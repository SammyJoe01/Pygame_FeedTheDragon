# **Feed the Dragon**
Feed the Dragon is a simple Pygame project where the player controls a dragon and tries to catch coins while avoiding missing them. The game gets progressively harder as the player catches more coins.

## **Getting Started**
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website, and Pygame can be installed using 
**pip install pygame**.
Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can run the game by running the file.

## **How to Play**
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the dragon up and down. The goal of the game is to catch as many coins as possible without missing any. If you miss a coin, you'll lose a life. The game is over when you run out of lives.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game by changing the values in the game values section of the file. For example, you can change the starting velocity of the coins, the acceleration rate of the coins, or the number of lives the player starts with.
You can also customise the fonts, sounds, and images used in the game by replacing the files in the fonts, sounds, and images folders.
